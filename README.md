# diffusion
## 1/4/2023 update:
Coded diffusion model with this Colab notebook as a heavy reference: 
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sjy9odlSSy0RBVgMTgP7s99NXsqglsUL?usp=sharing#scrollTo=bpN_LKYwuLx0
The loss is going down to around 0.13 but the sampled images almost always show just a blank canvas with a solid color, a heavy contrast
compared to the notebook.
Need to fix that bug, as well as potentially adding the text embedding to make the model stable diffusion.
